# Look at the following programs...

# x = 0
# 3.times do
#   x += 1
# end
# puts x
# and...

# y = 0
# 3.times do
#   y += 1
#   x = y
# end
# puts x
# What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

=begin
  
x prints 3 in the first ex. it prints an error in the second ex. This is because x is not defined
